### First Adventure
The cell was bare, even moreso than the usual monks cell or the barracks for novitiates. It was lacking the usual circuit board traceries in the concrete, the speakers playing liturgical binary codes. It contained only a single nutritional tube and the huddled mass of Iota. They had been imprisoned here for 1.5634672358 rad, the longest incarceration they had faced. Previous stays for missing duties, insubordination had been much shorter, but Iota knew this time would be different.
The door of the cell twisted open, and in came Alpha Shelly. Iota felt dread in their abdomen. The Maestro had come personally, their thousands of centipede legs making a rolling drumbeat announcing their presence. Iota fell into a position of submission, and awaited the word of their Master. 
There was a pause as the Maestro's sensors ran over Iota, then a whipcrack of code; "Iota Heinlein, do you know why you are here?"
Knowing only the truth would save him from further punishment, they answered, "I stole Farmer Dauphin-Lee's new Gorsh-Rikkonen 400c Comet Tractor, but Maestro he wasn't following the correct matienince cycles and-" 
Iota cut off his explanation at a slashing motion of the Shelly's dendrites. "No, novice. You the stolen tractor is not the problem. The Farmer tells me it is working better than ever after you returned it. The problem is you failed to consider how your reckless actions would effect the machinery of society in the area, particularly the monastery's reputation. When our neighbors don't trust us our work is hindered, like sand in the geartrain. Bad enough the Imperial Exciseman are breathing down our cowls, and you decide now is a good time to pull this stunt."
Shelly's body let's out a long weezing sigh, too long for a standard human. "One more rad, then you will be freed. I will set the door timer. Maybe this time will help you take the longer view, Novice."
