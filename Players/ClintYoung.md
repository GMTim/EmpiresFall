## Background
Clint Young ran a modest crime syndicate in sector 93, before everything fell apart. His network of smugglers, street toughs, and thugs for hire could once have gotten anything, from anywhere, to anywhere….for the right price. Clint, or “Killer Clint” in his youth, killed his first mark at the age of seven. By Fifteen, he ran a small organization of thieves, and at Twenty Three, he met what would be his downfall, Alice. For the next seven years, Clint and Alice established smuggling contacts, bribed ship captains and corrupted officials, amassing wealth and power. Clint was untouchable, happy, and for once found himself looking forward to a happy life, with violence behind him and only luxury ahead. And then Alice, his partner and only friend, arrested him. “Alice” was an Imperial Agent, undercover and planted specifically to investigate and arrest Clint. She was also the daughter of that first kill, now 23 years ago, and had devoted her life to bringing her father’s murderer to justice. And she did. Across sector 93, Clint’s associates, underbosses, and corrupted officials were arrested en masse and shipped off to prisons and penal colonies spread across several sectors. Clint’s syndicate was thoroughly stamped out, and he was left with nothing but his old, almost forgotten animal instincts, and a cold, burning hatred for his betrayer, “Alice.”
OK so how about [Known Criminal; Habitual (Criminal) Empire Builder] - Clint has given up on the idea of ever getting out of "the life", and now everywhere he goes he can't help but get his hands dirty in something - anything from small bribes and petty crime to outright murder - Clint just can't stay away. On some level...he needs to know he's left a mark - someone or something he can use to his advantage in the future. Just in case.

### First Adventure
Clint had been curled into the crawlspace above the freighter's cargo bay doors for 44 hours, sipping from water reserves sparingly, and moving as little as possible to avoid tearing the fragile ad-hoc thermal suit that Alice had helped to build. The ship's technician owed a significant gambling debt to a dangerous, impatient collector. The technician was also known to smuggle consumer electronics from the coreward worlds, and so this kill would be a doubly profitable, once Alice found a buyer for the contraband. Clint just needed to see where the technician was hiding them before getting down to the wetwork.
Alice had damaged the temperature regulating sensors just before Clint snuck aboard, and he had only to wait for the technician to make his rounds and look into the malfunction. Today was the day. The technician had run a diagnostic, and then fiddled with an access panel that had nothing to do with temperature regulation. Eureka.
Slowly, Clint emerged from the crawlspace and lowered himself to the cargo bay floor. The cheap material of the thermal suit rustled loudly and reflective material cracked and flaked, frigid air seeping in. No matter, the technician had proper gear, and certainly wouldn't need it in a few minutes. 
Six days later, the freighter captain discovered the broken, un-naturally folded remains of his technician in the cargo bay crawlspace, wrapped in a flimsy, cracked, home-made thermal suit. Next to the corpse was a dataslate displaying a new technician's CV and application to join the crew, and a cred-chip with a not insignificant value displayed prominently. A crude message was written on the floor near the body - "The new guy comes with less complications. You're welcome. -KC"
Clint left the freighter with a bounty to collect for the successful kill, a satchel full of valuable micro-electronics, a new freighter technician that owed him a favor, and a freighter captain that knew how to keep his mouth shut.

### Adventure with [Jace](./JaceDesai.md)
.... “Hey pseudo-bud, you wouldn’t happen to know where a Terran can score a whole lotta diamond dust within the next two cycles, would ya?” Jace squinted at the creature, unsure if it would answer or continue wasting his time.
"He doesn't, but I sure do. Let's talk, friend. I'm gonna float you down a river of the stuff if you're worth it." Clint had been watching this foppish noble sink himself into greater and greater debt with the Hrod gangsters on this world with extreme interest. Corrupt friends in high places provided the grease that KC's syndicate depended on to meet obligations....and make tidy profits. And the Hrod organization here was sloppy, nearly ripe for a hostile takeover.
"So listen.. Jace is it? I'm gonna introduce you to the late Maha's boss. No no, don't worry, I know a lady who knows a being who can smooth this whole unfortunate mess over for us. All you need to do is keep living it up, the same as before, but now you're a little closer to the source for the diamond dust, yes? Yes. And all I need from you in return is a letter of introduction so that I can meet the Desai Holdings representative on-world. At a specific place and all that. You understand."
Clint watched the nobles eyes, sharp with understanding for a brief moment before succumbing to the comfortable numbness that described most of his days. Yes, he did understand. Good. Everyone here was going to get very, very rich in the near future, and then Clint could finally buy that permanent suite on a resort-world for he and Alice.
30 cycles later, Clint was staring morosely at the wall of a small, cramped cell aboard a prison transport, bound for some godawful penal colony. Jace was similarly restrained across the cell, blathering on unmercifully.
"... I mean WOW, did you see how fast she threw you down and got those mag-restraints on? And you never knew? Like not at all? How could you not know? Whew, you must feel eeemmmmbaaaarasssed. And I mean, for me really the experience was just so EXCITING. Do you think they'll have diamond dust where we're going? Surely they must. Right? Right?...."
Clint prayed silently for death as the fop alternated between lamenting their situation and marveling at the efficiency in which Alice had dismantled Clint's entire life. One of the crew on this freighter owed Clint a favor, and had shown him a small mercy, and slipped him a flexible stiletto. Clint remained acutely aware of it's presence in his waistband as the insufferable fop continued without end, and the transport made its agonizingly slow journey across the stars.
