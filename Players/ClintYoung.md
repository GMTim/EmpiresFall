## Background
Clint Young ran a modest crime syndicate in sector 93, before everything fell apart. His network of smugglers, street toughs, and thugs for hire could once have gotten anything, from anywhere, to anywhere….for the right price. Clint, or “Killer Clint” in his youth, killed his first mark at the age of seven. By Fifteen, he ran a small organization of thieves, and at Twenty Three, he met what would be his downfall, Alice. For the next seven years, Clint and Alice established smuggling contacts, bribed ship captains and corrupted officials, amassing wealth and power. Clint was untouchable, happy, and for once found himself looking forward to a happy life, with violence behind him and only luxury ahead. And then Alice, his partner and only friend, arrested him. “Alice” was an Imperial Agent, undercover and planted specifically to investigate and arrest Clint. She was also the daughter of that first kill, now 23 years ago, and had devoted her life to bringing her father’s murderer to justice. And she did. Across sector 93, Clint’s associates, underbosses, and corrupted officials were arrested en masse and shipped off to prisons and penal colonies spread across several sectors. Clint’s syndicate was thoroughly stamped out, and he was left with nothing but his old, almost forgotten animal instincts, and a cold, burning hatred for his betrayer, “Alice.”

OK so how about [Known Criminal; Habitual (Criminal) Empire Builder] - Clint has given up on the idea of ever getting out of "the life", and now everywhere he goes he can't help but get his hands dirty in something - anything from small bribes and petty crime to outright murder - Clint just can't stay away. On some level...he needs to know he's left a mark - someone or something he can use to his advantage in the future. Just in case.
