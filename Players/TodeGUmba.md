## Background
My thought concept is like a Groot/Odo. My hope being this sentient fungal being was taken by empire for research not knowing his species are part of a hive mind (like the founders from ds9) while also having self identity. But all they know is that something is wrong with them because they don't know that needed connection and is very aggressive to the empire being the ones who have experimented on them.
Detained in airtight cell after multiple spore clouds and lash outs after imperial scientists found that the creature was sentient.

### First Adventure
Mycologist Saunders clocked in for his  shift at the lab ready to resume his studies. He had been having interesting developments on a specimen from G'Umbah labeled "Tode". The fungal specimen had grown much since brought to his lab. Much larger than most common fungal specimens this one has had to be moved into larger and larger enclosures. The pulsing mushroom cap seemed to almost breathe at times. Saunders went to snip some matter from the specimen when suddenly the cap shook releasing spores I to the air and immediately grabbing Saunders arm with a fungal arm of it's own. This had never happened before and the scientist panicked. He tried calling for help as he was unable to pull away from the specimen. He was finally able to reach the emergency alarm which started blaring. Tode leg go of the scientist and started to shrivel as small as it could before security came in. The room now full of a light fog of spores and Saunders lay on the ground with lacerations on his arm. The security guards didn't know what happened but pulled the scientist out and called Hazmat.
The specimen from G'Umbah being the only chamber open and lab notes the mycologist was working on was sealed and put away labeled as hazardous to never be opened.
Saunders did not return home that day...

### Adventure with [Clint](./ClintYoung.md)
A dug out pit deep the shanty alleys. Hidden, dark, the miasma of rot filling the air.
A commotion stirs meters away. The silhouette of two people come to the pit dragging something. In the dimness the two men are dragging a corpse. 
"Lets hurry up and dispose of him, this place gives me the creeps, not to mention the smell."
"Quiet ye git, 'memba las' dump Yoon came back with some lacerations. said som'in got em."
A soft gurgling can suddenly be heard over the commotion. The two men look at each other and one mouths "on three"... "One... Two... Three..." The men toss the corpse into the dump. The body thuds against the pile of decay as dust... debris... spores?  Puff up from the impact and suddenly a movement rushes the body. Something that can't be easily seen quickly on top of the new addition.
"Wha is that?" The one man says and reaches for his light source. 
"No Don't-" It was too late... The man turns it on and illuminates the mass grave. Upon the corpse was this mass of fleshy tangles... a... what looks like a hood of a mushroom... what could be described as appendages dotted with stringy ligaments and fleshy pores. With the light now upon it quickly turns to it and winces from the sudden change in brightness and lunges at the source grabbing onto the arm holding the light.
"Gah Get it off! Help me!"  The other man grabs onto the creature trying to wrestle it off. "It's grip is too tight! I need to cut it!"
The other man takes out his blade and raises it. The light glistens off the blade.
"Hold!", a very authoritative voice calls out as a third man walks into the area. The creature still struggling on the first man while he calls out. "Clint! Boss, 'elp! It's got me"
Clint now walks closer up and holds his hand out to the creature.
"Now there... are you what has taken up residence here?" 
The creature slowly turned to face Clint who was talking to him. In doing so loosened his grip where the frightened man was able to scramble away. "Careful Boss, tha' thing 'ill kill ya"
"Thank you for your concern Gentry. But I think that this 'Thing' is more than what it seems." Clint turns back to the being. "Do you have a name?"
The creature gains some composure and seems to size up the man in front of him. and a very earthy gutteral sound exits the being.
"I am Tode."
