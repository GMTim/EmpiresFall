## Background
My thought concept is like a Groot/Odo. My hope being this sentient fungal being was taken by empire for research not knowing his species are part of a hive mind (like the founders from ds9) while also having self identity. But all they know is that something is wrong with them because they don't know that needed connection and is very aggressive to the empire being the ones who have experimented on them.
Detained in airtight cell after multiple spore clouds and lash outs after imperial scientists found that the creature was sentient.

### First Adventure
Mycologist Saunders clocked in for his  shift at the lab ready to resume his studies. He had been having interesting developments on a specimen from G'Umbah labeled "Tode". The fungal specimen had grown much since brought to his lab. Much larger than most common fungal specimens this one has had to be moved into larger and larger enclosures. The pulsing mushroom cap seemed to almost breathe at times. Saunders went to snip some matter from the specimen when suddenly the cap shook releasing spores I to the air and immediately grabbing Saunders arm with a fungal arm of it's own. This had never happened before and the scientist panicked. He tried calling for help as he was unable to pull away from the specimen. He was finally able to reach the emergency alarm which started blaring. Tode leg go of the scientist and started to shrivel as small as it could before security came in. The room now full of a light fog of spores and Saunders lay on the ground with lacerations on his arm. The security guards didn't know what happened but pulled the scientist out and called Hazmat.
The specimen from G'Umbah being the only chamber open and lab notes the mycologist was working on was sealed and put away labeled as hazardous to never be opened.
Saunders did not return home that day...

### Adventure with [Clint](./ClintYoung.md)
A dug out pit deep the shanty alleys. Hidden, dark, the miasma of rot filling the air.
A commotion stirs meters away. The silhouette of two people come to the pit dragging something. In the dimness the two men are dragging a corpse. 
"Lets hurry up and dispose of him, this place gives me the creeps, not to mention the smell."
"Quiet ye git, 'memba las' dump Yoon came back with some lacerations. said som'in got em."
A soft gurgling can suddenly be heard over the commotion. The two men look at each other and one mouths "on three"... "One... Two... Three..." The men toss the corpse into the dump. The body thuds against the pile of decay as dust... debris... spores?  Puff up from the impact and suddenly a movement rushes the body. Something that can't be easily seen quickly on top of the new addition.
"Wha is that?" The one man says and reaches for his light source. 
"No Don't-" It was too late... The man turns it on and illuminates the mass grave. Upon the corpse was this mass of fleshy tangles... a... what looks like a hood of a mushroom... what could be described as appendages dotted with stringy ligaments and fleshy pores. With the light now upon it quickly turns to it and winces from the sudden change in brightness and lunges at the source grabbing onto the arm holding the light.
"Gah Get it off! Help me!"  The other man grabs onto the creature trying to wrestle it off. "It's grip is too tight! I need to cut it!"
The other man takes out his blade and raises it. The light glistens off the blade.
"Hold!", a very authoritative voice calls out as a third man walks into the area. The creature still struggling on the first man while he calls out. "Clint! Boss, 'elp! It's got me"
Clint now walks closer up and holds his hand out to the creature.
"Now there... are you what has taken up residence here?" 
The creature slowly turned to face Clint who was talking to him. In doing so loosened his grip where the frightened man was able to scramble away. "Careful Boss, tha' thing 'ill kill ya"
"Thank you for your concern Gentry. But I think that this 'Thing' is more than what it seems." Clint turns back to the being. "Do you have a name?"
The creature gains some composure and seems to size up the man in front of him. and a very earthy gutteral sound exits the being.
"I am Tode."

### Adventure with [Rocky](./Rocky.md)
Little activity had happened the past few days, no new bodies, no scuffles heard. Tode was relaxed in their hideout as no one wanted to be around the dead but they were able to digest as needed while also helping the natural decay to progress, able to let their guard down. Sadly they had become accustomed to a fresh corpse more often, the initial consumption leading to an addiction. 
Something approaches now, disturbing some airborne spores. Tode alerts themself and hides ready to snatch the new corpse being deposited. This large silhouette is unfamiliar, foreign, but continues to approach the mass pile. What is it? A Threat? Come to take them away? Certainly, the body droppers never came so close before. Quickly Tode must strike for this is their only home, nowhere to run, last place to hide. Little thought went in as they whipped a tendrel toward the intruder.
“NO Toooouuch!” roared the intruder as it slammed its appendages to the ground. Tode retracted its fungal tentacle and studied the being. Much different, not flesh, not fungal or organic but rock? Could this be another refugee like Tode? They lifted their hooded head up slightly and spoke softly “I am Tode.” A moment went by before the being responded “Rocky…. No touch, my precious.” the being pointed out their shell. They then seemed to let their own guard down before reaching out with their arm. “Tode, no human you want be friend? Human only hurt.” Tode thought for a moment analyzing this rockbeing before releasing more spores into the air. “I am Tode” they replied. Rocky seemed somewhat confused with the reply but came closer and sat next to Tode and began to explain his homeworld and what he was. Tode, not confident in how to communicate, began to illustrate to Rocky what they know of themselves using his tentacles with the dirt and mycelia on the ground. Seeming to come to some mild understanding of each other, Tode allowed Rocky to stay. Tode still struggled to branch concepts to explain through their odd illustrations.
