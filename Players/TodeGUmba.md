## Background
My thought concept is like a Groot/Odo. My hope being this sentient fungal being was taken by empire for research not knowing his species are part of a hive mind (like the founders from ds9) while also having self identity. But all they know is that something is wrong with them because they don't know that needed connection and is very aggressive to the empire being the ones who have experimented on them.

Detained in airtight cell after multiple spore clouds and lash outs after imperial scientists found that the creature was sentient.

### First Adventure
Mycologist Saunders clocked in for his  shift at the lab ready to resume his studies. He had been having interesting developments on a specimen from G'Umbah labeled "Tode". The fungal specimen had grown much since brought to his lab. Much larger than most common fungal specimens this one has had to be moved into larger and larger enclosures. The pulsing mushroom cap seemed to almost breathe at times. Saunders went to snip some matter from the specimen when suddenly the cap shook releasing spores I to the air and immediately grabbing Saunders arm with a fungal arm of it's own. This had never happened before and the scientist panicked. He tried calling for help as he was unable to pull away from the specimen. He was finally able to reach the emergency alarm which started blaring. Tode leg go of the scientist and started to shrivel as small as it could before security came in. The room now full of a light fog of spores and Saunders lay on the ground with lacerations on his arm. The security guards didn't know what happened but pulled the scientist out and called Hazmat.
The specimen from G'Umbah being the only chamber open and lab notes the mycologist was working on was sealed and put away labeled as hazardous to never be opened.
Saunders did not return home that day...
