## Background
A big sentient rock like person whose people were enslaved by the Empire for foot soldiers and muscle. He has been enslaved by the Empire for many years. They keep him around  for experimental research as he has become too hostile and unruly to use as a foot soldier. He wishes to live a free life one day among the stars.

Meet Rocky the sentient rock man from the planet Dio. He has a short temper and his real weakness is shiny objects. He loves collecting them even if it gets him in trouble.

### First Adventure

There once was a nice noble ship that landed on a new planet to hide out and getaway from it all. Kinda like a holiday for them. As soon as the ship landed it felt like an earthquake. Well it was a sentient rock man. They had just so happened to land on him while he was resting. So he proceeded to give the noble ship the beat down. He was eventually hunted, subdued and taken into custody. He was then sold to the empire be experimented upon.
