## Background
A big sentient rock like person whose people were enslaved by the Empire for foot soldiers and muscle. He has been enslaved by the Empire for many years. They keep him around  for experimental research as he has become too hostile and unruly to use as a foot soldier. He wishes to live a free life one day among the stars.
Meet Rocky the sentient rock man from the planet Dio. He has a short temper and his real weakness is shiny objects. He loves collecting them even if it gets him in trouble.

### First Adventure
There once was a nice noble ship that landed on a new planet to hide out and getaway from it all. Kinda like a holiday for them. As soon as the ship landed it felt like an earthquake. Well it was a sentient rock man. They had just so happened to land on him while he was resting. So he proceeded to give the noble ship the beat down. He was eventually hunted, subdued and taken into custody. He was then sold to the empire be experimented upon. 

### Adventure with [Tode](./TodeGUmba.md)
Rocky was a simple rock man that never needed much but he knew he did not belong here on this sand shit-show. Everyone stared him down when he was dropped off near the edge of town. Noticing this he rolled up and rolled in the opposite direction not caring where he was going as he didn't need any rations. With a smaller sun beating down on him he was weaker than he was on his last planet. Sun was the main source of his energy but he could also utilize some metals and raw ore as a substitute.
    All of a sudden the weather whipped up a huge dust devil and for fear of the sand eroding his precious exocoating he need to find a place to hide. He couldn't roll into town as he could never trust the biped meat-bags. All they did was hurt him and capture him.  Rolling away he stumbled upon a cave near the city that the populous avoided. The sand that was blasting him died down as he entered the cave. Thinking maybe he could find some raw ore in this cave he dived in. Taking it slow as he wasn't afraid but just unsure if it was inhabited. The cave was dark and full of strange fog extruding from the ground made Rocky optimistic that no one would ever come here. However, he did hear voices and they sounded close. He guessed the city must be overhead and he stubbled into the catacombs of this city. Walking down this next hallway the fog got heavy and these tiny floating balls he had never seen before started to cling to his outer shell. He thought nothing of it and moved on.
Later on, he found an opening to the city but this huge pile of corpses block his way further. Without notice, this long tentacle came out from the bodies and tried to grab him. "NO Toooouuch" He Roared in anger and he slammed the ground. The tentacle retracted and a mushroom head that blended in with the bodies in the dark spoke smoothly "I am Tode". "Rocky" he replied. "No touch", "My precious" as he pointed to his shell. Noticing that the mushroom was also sentient he thought to himself maybe make a friend. As he was lonely and could not trust the humans at this time he tried communicating with the mushroom. "Tode, no human you want be friend?  Human only hurt". Tode threw some spores in the air and replied, "I am Tode".  Not knowing what this meant Rocky sat next to him and carried on telling Tode about his homeworld. As he told his story Tode made weird pictures with his tentacles and mycelium on the ground that oddly looked like what he was explaining. That day rocky did make a friend and was no longer lonely.
