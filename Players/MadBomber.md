## Background
So my character is going to be a gunship AI who has been removed from its gunship and imprisoned in a fairly underwhelming avatar. It still doesnâ€™t fully understand what happened, and is bitter about being removed from its natural body, a crew scale gunship (think Defiant from DS9).

So for my character, it has always seen the universe in fairly black and white. If blowing something up was an option, then that was the option it would suggest. Even for a gunship, it was especially force motivated. Some would say to an excessive level. However, there is no arguing with results.

### First Adventure
The world was Harspring in Sector 31. IGS-78339 was 5th wing of the 3rd Fist for a regional Imperial Flight. The Dream Wars raged on, but this humble Sector was well out of the way of such things, and IGS-78339 was itching for more action. Suddenly, and without warning, a capitol mind ship took form, and fired its cognition beam at the command ship. Knocking out  the flight's coordination, and sewing chaos. While the fists attempted to reorganize, and command priority was shifting into the 1st Fist, IGS-78339 sprang into action. Its crew, a group of Drop Marines, and a small team of engineers, all green and not fully grasping what was happening dropped into their battle stations as quickly as they could. But by that point IGS-78339 had already brought it's main mass driver online and put a salvo square into enemy ship. A half a ton of carbon reenforced tungsten was quickly accelerated to near light speeds, and slammed into the conjured construct of this "Dreamer" who had attacked his fleet. It must have caught the enemy off guard, because before it could respond, IGS-78339 had flown into the opening it had created and using its particle cannons cut a swath of damage to the heart of the craft. There, it deployed its marines, giving them clear objectives, and providing cover as the "Dreamer" started to take action agains them. Too slow was it with its response though, and the marines broke into its protective shell, and secured the construct. By the time the Fist's had properly formed up, the threat was over. IGS-78339 gained the nickname Mad Bomber, and went on to fight many more battles in the Dream Wars.
