## Background
So my character is going to be a gunship AI who has been removed from its gunship and imprisoned in a fairly underwhelming avatar. It still doesn’t fully understand what happened, and is bitter about being removed from its natural body, a crew scale gunship (think Defiant from DS9).

So for my character, it has always seen the universe in fairly black and white. If blowing something up was an option, then that was the option it would suggest. Even for a gunship, it was especially force motivated. Some would say to an excessive level. However, there is no arguing with results.

### First Adventure
The world was Harspring in Sector 31. IGS-78339 was 5th wing of the 3rd Fist for a regional Imperial Flight. The Dream Wars raged on, but this humble Sector was well out of the way of such things, and IGS-78339 was itching for more action. Suddenly, and without warning, a capitol mind ship took form, and fired its cognition beam at the command ship. Knocking out  the flight's coordination, and sewing chaos. While the fists attempted to reorganize, and command priority was shifting into the 1st Fist, IGS-78339 sprang into action. Its crew, a group of Drop Marines, and a small team of engineers, all green and not fully grasping what was happening dropped into their battle stations as quickly as they could. But by that point IGS-78339 had already brought it's main mass driver online and put a salvo square into enemy ship. A half a ton of carbon reenforced tungsten was quickly accelerated to near light speeds, and slammed into the conjured construct of this "Dreamer" who had attacked his fleet. It must have caught the enemy off guard, because before it could respond, IGS-78339 had flown into the opening it had created and using its particle cannons cut a swath of damage to the heart of the craft. There, it deployed its marines, giving them clear objectives, and providing cover as the "Dreamer" started to take action agains them. Too slow was it with its response though, and the marines broke into its protective shell, and secured the construct. By the time the Fist's had properly formed up, the threat was over. IGS-78339 gained the nickname Mad Bomber, and went on to fight many more battles in the Dream Wars.

### Adventure with [Rocky](./Rocky.md)
/* IGS-78339 online *
/* Diagnostics: Green *
/* Warning: Avatar Mode Enabled (Low Powered Service Droid) *
The fuck? Low powered service droid? I open my eyes and I see a bright blue sky and a lot of garbage sort of pilled up. I quickly realize what low powered service droid means when I look down at my limited articulated hands as I pull my self upright. Apparently my boot up sequence was activated, and then I was thrown into a dirt road surrounded by hovels that look like they are built from discarded crate pallets. I get to my feet, and see that this body I find myself in has only enough power for a single day of operation. I try to query any nearby data nodes and am only met with a single short data burst.
“Welcome to Hell: Food and power is only released once a day, if you miss meal time you will forfeit until the next day. If you power down, that is your own problem.” This message along with a small map that shows charge stations. I try to get my bearings as a small group of what must be the welcome wagon approaches me.
“What do we have here, another AI? Might as well scra…”, before he could finish his thought, I jam my pointed hand into his throat. I recalibrate my expectations of this body as I realize that while I have incapacitated my adversary, I did not break his neck as I had intended. His fellows surround me as he coughs and whizzes his way to the ground. I do a quick analysis, and launch myself at the weakest link in their group, looking to punch a hole in their formation, and recapture battle field advantage. However, their shock at the lose of their leader was short lived, and they successfully predicted my gambit. I decide to take what victory I can, and shoulder the creature into a big pile of rocks. Or at least what I thought was a big pile of rocks.
As my assailants grab me, and start to beat me with makeshift clubs, the rocks stand up. I’ve never seen this species before, but rage is a distressingly universal emotion, and before anyone can react he has already thrown one of these gang member through a nearby structure. The others pick up and run away. The rock creature roars at the fleeing bandits and then as he settles back down to the ground muttering, “fuck those guys”. Fuck those guys indeed.

### Adventure with [Jace Desai](./JaceDesai.md)
“What do you say?” said the creature that called itself Jace Desai.
Well? What could one say when they where about to lose autonomy? I knew my core wasn’t in this shell. In fact I was pretty sure I still had to be in my gunship. It’s a delicate thing removing an AI core even with it’s cooperation. And I assume I was less then compliant. I was going to need allies to escape this place, and I was also going to need more power. This Jace Desai just offered both. In the few milliseconds I spend weighing the pros and cons, my power reserve had shifted even lower. It was time to take a leap of faith. “Yes” I said with a great amount of distortion, right before my body started to cascade into a last ditch power saving mode.
I’m not sure how long I was out, but when I came around I saw I was connected to what looked like a taped together battery. My regulator informed me the power coursing in was suboptimal, but that hardly mattered, soon I’d be fully charged.
“See”, Jace said, grinning, “I told you I could hook you up.”
A few weeks later, Jace came into our small HQ, a place we had taken from another gang. Some of their blood still stained the walls, but mostly it had been cleaned out. “Hey MB, I got some news. My contact on the inside said they haven’t got a shipment from the Core Worlds in months, and that the supplies inside the base are starting to dwindle. They said they where prepping all the space craft they could at the top of the elevator, and are about to abandon this planet. Now, that’s interesting in an of itself, means our lives are going to get tricky. But then he told me something that made me think of you. He said there is a gunship, an older style one, but no one could get into it. Completely locked down. They are planning on blowing the moors and just let it burn up if they can’t figure it out soon. What’ya think?”
“I think that’s my body, and I think we are going to get it back,” I said, just a hint of anticipation in my voice, “go get the others, we have a fortress to storm.”
