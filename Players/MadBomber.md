## Background
So my character is going to be a gunship AI who has been removed from its gunship and imprisoned in a fairly underwhelming avatar. It still doesnâ€™t fully understand what happened, and is bitter about being removed from its natural body, a crew scale gunship (think Defiant from DS9).

So for my character, it has always seen the universe in fairly black and white. If blowing something up was an option, then that was the option it would suggest. Even for a gunship, it was especially force motivated. Some would say to an excessive level. However, there is no arguing with results.
