## Background
ok ok ok... lets see here... I think I'm going to make a character entirely from outside sector 93, I actually like the idea of a 2-bit noble from a minor house of some notability in the core worlds, just kind of swept up in court intrigue and imprisoned out in the boonies. I kinda like the idea of not even knowing why I was imprisoned and shuffled off into the middle of nowhere, plus like my whole shit naturally is to get back to the core worlds -- all the craziness going on is sort of an incidental complication to doing so, lol

Okay anyways, gonna go with... Jace Desai, 9th in line to inherit the Desai holdings, a minor family on one of the more important Core Worlds somewhere in sectors 1-9. I think his trouble is easy enough: [Hopeless Addict]. I could be much more specific, but I kind of want it to be extremely broad -- was he addicted to drugs? wealth? The prestige of his family name? Money, cars, women? Yes, yes, yes to all of it. 

### First Adventure

“Maha, my man, I’m * hic * good for it! A day ish… is all I need, I just gotta move around some of my assetsh and you’ll have your money. Where’sh the trust between business associates, huh? Does my family name really mean so li—hoouuf!” Jace doubled over in pain as H’Mari Maha’s pseudopod slammed into his guts, then slowly collapsed to his knees, gasping for air. Maha’s amorphous form wriggled rhythmically, signaling either mirth or anger or… some other emotion. Jace was never able to get a read on Hrod, a failing perhaps related to his current circumstances, he mused to himself. The speech vacuoles in Maha’s matrix vibrated unsettlingly, approximating the sounds of the common galactic tongue: *“Thhiiiss oonee obbssseerves no* DESAI*, jjussstt aa Ppatthetiicc jjuuunkiee. Jjaacce’s wwoordd aandd fammillyy nnammee aarree wwoortth nnoonnee tto tthiiss ooonne. Tthhiiss oonee’ss lloss wiill bbee reccoouped bbyyy ootthherr mmeanns.”* Maha gestured with another pseudopod to their compatriots, two Terrans obviously gene-bred for muscle mass, and generated several more fine-motor pseudopods, delicately picking up the assorted grisly yet finely-maintained surgical tools arrayed before them. Jace continued to writhe in pain on the floor, clutching his abdomen as the two henchmen approached. As they grabbed for him, he deftly popped his left pinky out of its socket, thumbed its biometric ignition, and rolled to a combat-ready crouch. With an almost imperceptible whine the monomolecular vibrosaber extended to its full length and powered up.

Later, a migratory Hrod quietly undergoing mitosis in a back alley contracts in surprise as a nearby door slams open. The Hrod cautiously generates a vision node, spying a noble fop in expensive-looking but blood-and-cytoplasm-drenched garb calmly exiting into the alley, holding a crystalline bottle half-full of jet-black liquid – Deluge or Onyx, most likely. He steps confidently into the alley, takes a swig of the liquid, and hurls the bottle against the wall, unleashing a string of curses as it shatters. “Fuck. Fuck! That was my only diamond dust supplier…” Then he notices the Hrod deeper in the alley, despite the reactive camouflage the Hrod instinctively activated the second the door slammed open. “Hey *pseudo-bud*, you wouldn’t happen to know where a Terran can score a whole lotta diamond dust within the next two cycles, would ya?”
