## Background
ok ok ok... lets see here... I think I'm going to make a character entirely from outside sector 93, I actually like the idea of a 2-bit noble from a minor house of some notability in the core worlds, just kind of swept up in court intrigue and imprisoned out in the boonies. I kinda like the idea of not even knowing why I was imprisoned and shuffled off into the middle of nowhere, plus like my whole shit naturally is to get back to the core worlds -- all the craziness going on is sort of an incidental complication to doing so, lol

Okay anyways, gonna go with... Jace Desai, 9th in line to inherit the Desai holdings, a minor family on one of the more important Core Worlds somewhere in sectors 1-9. I think his trouble is easy enough: [Hopeless Addict]. I could be much more specific, but I kind of want it to be extremely broad -- was he addicted to drugs? wealth? The prestige of his family name? Money, cars, women? Yes, yes, yes to all of it. 

### First Adventure
“Maha, my man, I’m * hic * good for it! A day ish… is all I need, I just gotta move around some of my assetsh and you’ll have your money. Where’sh the trust between business associates, huh? Does my family name really mean so li—hoouuf!” Jace doubled over in pain as H’Mari Maha’s pseudopod slammed into his guts, then slowly collapsed to his knees, gasping for air. Maha’s amorphous form wriggled rhythmically, signaling either mirth or anger or… some other emotion. Jace was never able to get a read on Hrod, a failing perhaps related to his current circumstances, he mused to himself. The speech vacuoles in Maha’s matrix vibrated unsettlingly, approximating the sounds of the common galactic tongue: *“Thhiiiss oonee obbssseerves no* DESAI*, jjussstt aa Ppatthetiicc jjuuunkiee. Jjaacce’s wwoordd aandd fammillyy nnammee aarree wwoortth nnoonnee tto tthiiss ooonne. Tthhiiss oonee’ss lloss wiill bbee reccoouped bbyyy ootthherr mmeanns.”* Maha gestured with another pseudopod to their compatriots, two Terrans obviously gene-bred for muscle mass, and generated several more fine-motor pseudopods, delicately picking up the assorted grisly yet finely-maintained surgical tools arrayed before them. Jace continued to writhe in pain on the floor, clutching his abdomen as the two henchmen approached. As they grabbed for him, he deftly popped his left pinky out of its socket, thumbed its biometric ignition, and rolled to a combat-ready crouch. With an almost imperceptible whine the monomolecular vibrosaber extended to its full length and powered up.
Later, a migratory Hrod quietly undergoing mitosis in a back alley contracts in surprise as a nearby door slams open. The Hrod cautiously generates a vision node, spying a noble fop in expensive-looking but blood-and-cytoplasm-drenched garb calmly exiting into the alley, holding a crystalline bottle half-full of jet-black liquid – Deluge or Onyx, most likely. He steps confidently into the alley, takes a swig of the liquid, and hurls the bottle against the wall, unleashing a string of curses as it shatters. “Fuck. Fuck! That was my only diamond dust supplier…” Then he notices the Hrod deeper in the alley, despite the reactive camouflage the Hrod instinctively activated the second the door slammed open. “Hey *pseudo-bud*, you wouldn’t happen to know where a Terran can score a whole lotta diamond dust within the next two cycles, would ya?”

### Adventure with [MB](./MadBomber.md)
IGS-78339’s proximity sensors pinged, triggering the activation of the rest of its sensory suite. “-- Been watching you the past few days, scrounging out in the scrapheap.” Something was talking to it in a hushed tone. Speech pattern analysis suggested Terran or one of the many gene-bred off-shoots. IGS-78339’s internal clock indicated recharge was still four cycles away, possibly more if delivery was late again. Its power was critically low, hence the droid had hidden itself away and powered down until recharge time. It would need to act fast to neutralize this threat while conserving what little power remained. “Saw you take on a whole gang of scabs by yourself! Really impressive, I… wait, are you dead…?” *Tink! Tink!* Pressure sensors indicated light tapping on the glass of its optics. “Ah shit… I’m gonna have to—Glllk!” Servos sprang into action with a whine and the droid’s arm flashed out, grabbing the Terran by the neck and unceremoniously cutting his words short.
At full power even this basic droid frame would have been capable of crushing its assailant’s windpipe, but in its current state it could do little more than surprise and lightly choke the Terran. No matter, IGS-78339 knew how to apply minimal force to deadly effect. Its optics whirred open, focusing on the threat. The Terran caught in its grasp was wrapped in heavy cloth robes, but its optics picked up scraps of what must have once been fine silks and nanoweaves peaking out from underneath. A noble from the core worlds, perhaps? IGS-78339’s drew its other arm back and formed its digits into a rough knife point, preparing to strike up through the nasal cavity. Before it could strike, the Terran kicked out at IGS-78339’s central frame and yanked himself free of its grasp, sprawling backwards and gasping for air through choked gasps. IGS-78339 raised itself up on its legs to pursue and dispatch the threat, but a cascade of warnings pinged on its HUD as its arm servos ground to a halt. The power draw was too much to operate all four limbs and its sensor suite simultaneously; this was going to be more difficult than it thought.
Between choking fits the Terran spat out in a hoarse trill, “You fucking psycho robot, I’m here to make a proposition, not strip you for damned parts!” IGS-78339 slumped back down to the ground and powered down all non-essential functions, re-routing power to voice modulation. “Ah, it’s not to be violence then. My apologies, meatbag. Speak.” Even having re-routed power to speech, its sensors picked up a clear tinny drone in its own voice – if the Terran didn’t know its power was critical before, he did now. “Name’s Jace Desai. I need muscle, and you *clearly* need power – I think we can help each other out. I’ve got an in with one of the guards here, they can supply me with extra rations, both food and power, but I’ve got no way to hold on to any of it without extra muscle. I’ve seen your kind of service droid crush a man’s windpipe with no effort, so I know you’re hurting for it. On the other hand, I’ve *never* seen your kind of service droid handle a group of killers with the grace and efficiency of an Imperial war droid. I don’t know what kind of AI core you are but you sure as shit haven’t spent your operational life unloading cargo from freighters. Anyway, with my connections and your potential for murder we might be able to eke out something a little bit better here than just mere survival. What do you say?”
