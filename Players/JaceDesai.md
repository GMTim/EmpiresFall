## Background
ok ok ok... lets see here... I think I'm going to make a character entirely from outside sector 93, I actually like the idea of a 2-bit noble from a minor house of some notability in the core worlds, just kind of swept up in court intrigue and imprisoned out in the boonies. I kinda like the idea of not even knowing why I was imprisoned and shuffled off into the middle of nowhere, plus like my whole shit naturally is to get back to the core worlds -- all the craziness going on is sort of an incidental complication to doing so, lol

Okay anyways, gonna go with... Jace Desai, 9th in line to inherit the Desai holdings, a minor family on one of the more important Core Worlds somewhere in sectors 1-9. I think his trouble is easy enough: [Hopeless Addict]. I could be much more specific, but I kind of want it to be extremely broad -- was he addicted to drugs? wealth? The prestige of his family name? Money, cars, women? Yes, yes, yes to all of it.
