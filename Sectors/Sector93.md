## Rumors
### Abandonded Tech
"Experimental wormhole generator" Found abandoned by the Empire. Imperial scientists worked to research the purpose of the structure. Determining that it was a way to open a wormhole in space they tried activating it but something happened and the researchers mysteriously disappeared. The massive device was then made off limits by the Empire.

### Collectors
There are rumors that Imperial Agents sometimes used small AI to procure the funds they needed to carry out their operations. people say these AI where often housed in small boxes shaped like treasure chests. These Mostly Intelligent Monetary Interest Collectors could be plugged into any electronic monetary system to scrape the thousand percent off rounding errors and gain a small fortune. anytime someone comes unto any money people will jokingly accuse them of Having one of these devices, but anyone without the right codes wouldnt be able to make it work.

### Data Grab
This being the periphery, there is a lot of active prospecting, exploration, and surveying still to do. This being at the height of the empire's power (or rather, maybe just a bit past it at this point), I think it would have refined the process to a largely automated one. Dumb-AI probes deep-scanning stellar phenomena, networked nano bot planetary survey swarms, even preliminary terraforming equipment is all part of the Empire's exploration forces. There are some crewed deep-space exploration vessels still out on decades-long assignments as well. Should anybody manage to find any of these equipment, they would be treated to a wealth of navigational, survey, and scientific data that could lead to as-yet untapped resources. The dangers are many, though. Others out in the peripherary have started to realize the Empire isn't in any position to worry about its exploratory fleet, leading to a sort of gold rush for unsavory types. In addition, the universe has proved to be a dangerous place -- you can never be sure who or what is out there, although it's often enough something that wants to kill you that the Empire saw fit to automate this process in the first place.

### Lost Warriors
During the Battle of Prix in the Dream Wars, a small Shift Ship filled with Jax Warriors disappeared while performing a drop. The ship suddenly engaged its warp drives, and just vanished. Rumors since that time have had the ship simply appear in random systems, and then disappeared again before any vessel could follow up. Recently the ship has been spotted appearing in the Sector 93, and the appearances seem to be getting more frequent.

### Mysterious Planet
There is rumor of a small metal rich planet made of billions giant hexagons out there. Very few have live to see it and know it's secrets. Talk is that the metal is like something never seen before. Floating off in an unusual orbit it is like it's moving on its own. Is it a giant nest or a ship or city  from and ancient way gone civilization no one knows. One things for sure awesome looking or not it may be something that you will never come back from.

 - Complication: **[Danger!!!]**

### Oracle
It is said a child was born during a massive solar flare. The coronal mass ejection and subsequent electromagnetic storms severely damaged a passing starliner, and obliterated all life at it’s destination, a small agricultural colony in sector 93. The navigational AI successfully landed the craft on the burning, lifeless remains of that world, placed the surviving passengers in stasis, and activated it’s distress beacon. When rescue teams arrived some years later, the only remaining life form was the infant - all other stasis units had failed.  As this child grew, it became clear it was….different. It knows things that could not be known. It speaks languages long forgotten, and sees the ever twisting paths of what may be. It is worshipped by some, and feared by many. It speaks of doom, and death, and a great breaking.

 - Complication: **[Shunned And Feared, Has Never Known Friendship Or Kindness]**
