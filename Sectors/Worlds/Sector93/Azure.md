### Shura Choole

Shura Choole is a rather unassuming capital-B Bureaucrat on Azure. She runs the tithe collection operations on Azure, and she ensures those resources are ready for pickup by Core World transport ships. Private citizens, businesses, even the cartels; nobody on Azure is free of the tithes. The recent assassination of the Imperial Governor may have thrown the system into chaos, but thanks to Choole’s efforts the ripple effects have yet to disrupt her organization. Many other essential government services have already started to break down, and while the cracks are beginning to show even in Choole’s organization, she still collects. Even the cartels still pay, too busy jockeying for supremacy amongst themselves, and individually too weak to directly oppose the might of the Imperial peacekeeping fleet stationed in the system.
One might ask: why collect tithes if the Core Worlds haven’t come to collect of late? This and other questions are of no concern to Choole. She was tasked by the Governor to oversee tithing operations, and as a consummate professional she’ll continue to do so until external pressures force the bureaucratic machine to grind to a halt. Her continued steadfast and ruthless adherence to bureaucratic policies and procedures is seen as something of a relief by many that work under her – the comfort of the status quo is highly appealing in increasingly turbulent times. There are some that seek to skirt her ironclad rule, however, sensing an opportunity for profit amidst the growing chaos. With no external powers able to, or even yet wholly interested in, directly opposing the Imperial machine, Choole has focused her organization’s attention increasingly inward: plugging internal loopholes, auditing suspicious paper trails and transactions, and rooting out and expelling those who seek to undermine her authority.
