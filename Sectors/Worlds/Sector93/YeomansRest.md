### Primus Pilus Agaeus Scipii
Primus Pilus Agaeus Scipii, last living Cataphractii, dutifully guards the dwindling trade lanes of Yeoman's Rest. The Cataphractii were a mercenary organization in possession of significant space and aerospace assets, hired to protect the then-new research station thousands of years ago. The duty to protect this place has passed from parent to child, generation after generation, despite the dwindling importance of the place itself, the shifting of major trade routes, and the slow death by attrition of the Cataphractii as an organization. Now a glorified sheriff of a stellar "truck-stop", Agaeus dutifully patrols the nebula, facing threats as they arise and defending this hereditary post. His ship is heavily armed and combat ready, but re-supply is irregular and traders themselves increasingly unreliable. Communications with coreward worlds have gone unanswered in recent times, and throughout the nebula is a pervasive feeling of.....malevolence.
