### Mine-It Mining Operator M1N41E aka Mini
An AI general system coordinator spun off of the Mine-It General Seed AI only 1500 years ago. Assigned to Humare's Arm to oversee resource extraction, it has been coordinating system traffic and resource extraction priority since the system was first colonized. It has recently become concerned by the reduced output, and because of the Empire's reduced interaction with the system, it has come to the conclusion that the system is nearing its end of usefulness. To that end, Mini has been commissioning the equipment needed to pull the rest of the hydrogen off of the central star. While it has been ordering Mine-It equipment and resources to leave the system, it hasn't felt the need to warn off any of the many independent operators still working the system. Soon though, the last piece of equipment will be in place, and a controlled detonation of the star will allow for one last massive haul by the Mine-It corporation, and Mini will soon have served its purpose. Currently Mini inhabits the central station near the system primary, overseeing the installation of the equipment to rip the star apart. It has a large Mine-It resource platform sitting on the edge of the controlled explosion.
